# Simpson's 1/3 rule.

Numerical evaluation of integral by Simpson's 1/3 Rule. If an odd amount of intervals is present, trapezoid rule is used for the last value.  Contains an error check to see if x is evenly spaced, and x and y are of equal length.

Inputs
-  x = the vector of equally spaced independent variable
-  y = the vector of function values with respect to x
Outputs:
-  I = the numerical integral calculated
